### DESCRIPTION

The SignalFx Smart Gateway observes every transaction across distributed services, generates metrics for each unique span and trace path, and prioritizes interesting outlier traces to forward to SignalFx as part of our NoSampleâ„¢ Tail-Based Distributed Tracing feature. The Smart Gateway can be deployed as a scalable, self-coordinating cluster for high-availability and volume applications.
